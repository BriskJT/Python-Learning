# Python Learning

This repository contains my Python learning journey, organized by week.

Each week builds on the last. I am starting with the basics and ending with full projects.

## Structure
| Folder | Focus |
|---------|--------|
| week1/ | Fundamentals (variables, conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries) |
| week2/ | Functions, files, and modules |
| week3/ | Object-oriented programming and APIs |
| week4/ | Mini-projects and integration work |

## Goals
- Practice Python daily
- Add comments explaining every step
- Commit code regularly to track progress
